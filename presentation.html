<p>The <e> push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository</e>. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. ... Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing.
</p>
<p>The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Note that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed</p>

<p><b>clone<b> is Used to clone the repository into a new directory</p>
<p><b>remote<b> The remote name is a short-hand label for a remote repository. "origin" is the conventional default name for the first remote and is usually where you push to when you don't specify a remote for git. You can set up more than one remote for your local repo and you use the remote name when pushing to them</p>
<p><b>origin</b>In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from. More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository's URL - and thereby makes referencing much easier. Note that origin is by no means a "magical" name, but just a standard convention</p>

<p> The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.</p>
